    <h1 class="jumbotron-fluid">About Us</h1>
    <p>J&J books is a project that aims to connect people who have an excess of physical books, with people who want to read them!
      When you sign up and join this service you will list some basic personal information and be able to list your books! Once listed other users can view them and create
      a request to check them out! Once you are notified that someone requested your book you can approve or deny the request, and then contact them directly to arrange
      a method to send them the book!
