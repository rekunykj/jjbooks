# jjbooks

School Project containing a back-end PHP api using Doctrine ORM for objects.
Front-end is done completely in vue.js and native Javascript.

//TODO
API supports functionality to make requests creating new orders, but user-interface and API calls are to be done.

Basic user authentication is present but should use OAuth or another credential provider.

Paging should be allowed to prevent too many results when searching books and getting a larger result.
